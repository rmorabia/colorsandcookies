# COLORS AND COOKIES

An idle clicker game based on Earthbound, joy, and rainbows.

## Beginning of the Game:

We have a hero. Their name is [something cool here]. They're just your normal everyday kiddo. One day, they wake up, and their whole world is in black and white, and super plain and boring. They go outside, and the other color they see is in a slime. In order to get the color back, they destroy the slime. And then they set off on an adventure to get the color back from all the monsters. 

## Goal:

Destroy all monsters and get color back in their world.

## End of the Game:

The kiddo and their friends restore color to the world because they found every hex code in the universe. There are 16,777,216 colors, and our crew got them all. Kabam slam. Color gets restored back to the world and everything's chill now.

It should take a number of slimes killed to get a hex code back. For each slime killed, that number should increase.
